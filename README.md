Difference between Template Method pattern and Strategy pattern

With the Template Method pattern, we make our decision when we pick our concrete subclass. In the Strategy pattern, we make our decision by selecting a strategy class at runtime

The motive behind the Strategy pattern is to supply the context with an object that knows how to perform some variation on an algorithm.
